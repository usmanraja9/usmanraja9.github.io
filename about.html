                        Irishwrecksonline - on the internet since 1997

                        <br>
                        This award winning site is the on-going result of many years of gathering information on the dived wrecks around the whole of the Irish coast. Information held on each wreck site is in a "potted" form, as most divers only require the bare bones with regards to historical details.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If further information is required on a particular vessel, the publications and personnel from whom the details were gleaned are also included.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Photographs of some of the vessels are credited where known, but in particular, thanks must go to Dr. Edward J. Bourke for the free use of his extensive photo library, and to Michael Montgomery, Castlereagh SAC, for his tireless searching of the internet.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As always, divers are requested to "look but not touch", so that others coming behind you can marvel at the treasures beneath our waves.
